Archaeological evidence suggests that early hominids inhabited China between 250,000 and 2.24 million years ago.[33] A cave in Zhoukoudian (near present-day Beijing) exhibits hominid fossils dated at between 680,000 and 780,000 BCE.[34] The fossils are of Peking Man, an example of Homo erectus who used fire.[35] Fossilised teeth of Homo sapiens dating to 125,000â€“80,000 BCE have been discovered in Fuyan Cave in Dao County, Hunan.[36] Chinese proto-writing existed in Jiahu around 7000 BC,[37] Dadiwan from 5800 BC to 5400 BC, Damaidi around 6000 BC [38] and Banpo dating from the 5th millennium BC. Some scholars have suggested that Jiahu symbol (7th millennium BC) was the earliest Chinese writing system.[37]
